## Short Intro
My path wasn’t typical - engineer turned MBA, then tackling diverse industries from infrastructure to clean-tech. From startups to running my own manpower services company, I’ve seen it all.

## Long Intro
My journey might have started as the typical. I started with engineering from NIT Hamirpur and then went on to get my MBA from Indian School of Business.

However, my real education came from working across different industries - infrastructure, telecom, transportation, clean-tech - and across different company sizes - MNCs, startups, and even running my own business.

This diverse background means I’ve faced (and tackled!) a wide range of business challenges.

In 2019, I took over my late father’s manpower services company, putting those experiences to the test in the real world.

###  Why does this matter to you?
Because in this blog, I’m not going to share theoretical advice. I’m going to share the practical tools and strategies I’ve developed while running my business. It is not the kind of stuff you won’t find reading about startups and big corporations.

Think of it as war stories from the trenches, with actionable tips to help you win your battles.

## What this blog is all about
Running my own business has been one heck of a learning experience! I want to share the highs, lows and everything in between in hopes it helps other business owners.

Most resources focus on startups or big companies, but not those with smaller businesses. This means I’ve had to figure stuff out through trial and error.

Over the past few years, I’ve managed to develop tech tools, processes and hacks that I expect will add value for fellow small business owners.

Outside of work, I love travelling, photography, reading and music.

This blog is a work in progress. I plan to cover whatever topics catch my interest. I’ll organise posts so you can easily find what you’re here for.

I write to share my experiences in hopes someone finds it useful while providing an inside look at running a small business.
