Below is a list of options available to generate your first good-quality draft. I have provided the final prompt I use when I am researching for a new blog post

- Top-level market sizing is only important to understand if it's a big market or a small market. The size of the market provides you with the potential for how big your business can become
- Bottom Level: This is the size that lets you make business plans clear as you will be able to identify all the key metrics and factors at play to grow your business. Developing such plans helps you in clarifying on multiple aspects of your business

### Sample Personal Beliefs

-Working in a startup provides learning opportunities that are hard to come by elsewhere. In my view, if you are comfortable with frequent changes, I would suggest working for 2-3 years to set the stage for better future career prospects. The problems you face in a startup are multiplied when compared to working for a conventional MNC, while also helping you learn what not to do with the least career impact. I would certainly recommend conversing with a few individuals to get a sense of the company and even the team you will be joining, to avoid future shocks.
