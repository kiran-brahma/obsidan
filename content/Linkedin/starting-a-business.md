So you've got a brilliant business idea and keen to build it on the side. Your basic product or service is ready and even obtained a few paying customers. Now most would jump straight to start a Private Limited form. But is this the best way forward?
 
There's a simpler way to start:
- Consider a proprietorship (for solo ventures) or a partnership (for a team of 2 or more)
	- Easier to manage and tax-friendly.
	- Profits you Withdraw are taxed once, against twice in Pvt Ltd.
	- Leverage Section 44AD for an even further tax reduction

- Avoid the hassle of Compliance and paperwork.
	- If you are a director, your existing firm can label this "moonlighting."

- You can avail most benefits
	- GST Registration
	- Utilise a trade name for your side hustle,
	- PAN card for partnership firms. Proprietorship you use your PAN
	- Open a current account.

- Unless you advertise it, your current organisation won't know about your side hustle, avoiding any complications.

**Key Takeaway: Proprietorship or partnership offers a simpler, more tax-efficient way to run your side hustle discreetly while you commence your entrepreneurial dreams**
